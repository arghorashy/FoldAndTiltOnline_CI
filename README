As a friend and I were splitting a bill, she showed me how you can fold and tilt the faces on paper currency to make them appear to grin (sometimes mischievously) or to frown.

Fascinated, I wrote a program that would simulate the illusion for any picture containing a face.  

This repository aims to expose this simulation in a web app.  To see the respository for the original stand-alone C++ program, please visit https://github.com/arghorashy/foldandtilt.


Setup Instructions
------------------
- Clone this from Git into a folder called FATOCI.
- Clone https://github.com/arghorashy/foldandtilt called FAT.
- Follow OpenCV installation instructions in FAT README, if you don't have it installed.
- Follow CMake instructions in FAT README to make executable for your platform.
- Copy the contents of FAT/FoldAndTilt/CMake/bin/Release to FATOCI/bin/foldandtilt. (Might need to create some of those folders.)


Setup Instructions that you shouldn't have to follow... but you do... for now...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Modify line in .htaccess from 
	"RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://localhost/~afsheen/foldandtiltonlineCI/index.php/$1 [L]"
to
	"RewriteRule ^(.*)$ <your server address>/index.php/$1 [L]"
- Make folder FATOCI/uploads and make sure the server can write to it.


Todo
- For the AJAX calls, remove the dataType attribute.  When it's JSON like that, it parses all returns as JSON all the time--even the PHP errors.  That means we cannot see the PHP errors!  It would be better to call a JSON.parse function manually at the beginning of the success function calls.
- Is it really necessary to upload and also download the original picture?  I think so, but intuitively, that seems silly...
- Fix "Setup Instructions that you shouldn't have to follow... but you do... for now..."
- Add entry in .htaccess to restrict upload size.
- Fix permission of uploads folder
